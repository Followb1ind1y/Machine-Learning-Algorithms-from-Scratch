        "A **Decision Tree** is a non-parametric **supervised learning** algorithm. A tree has many analogies in real life, and turns out that it has influenced a wide area of machine learning, covering both **classification and regression**. Decision tree learning employs a **divide and conquer strategy** by conducting a **greedy search** to identify the optimal split points within a tree. This process of splitting is then repeated in a top-down, recursive manner until all, or the majority of records have been classified under specific class labels.\n",

        "**Classification and regression trees** are machine-learning methods for constructing prediction models from data. The models are obtained by recursively partitioning the data space and fitting a simple prediction model within each partition. As a result, the partitioning can be represented graphically as a decision tree. Classification trees are designed for **dependent variables that take a finite number of unordered values**, with prediction error measured in terms of **misclassification cost**. Regression trees are for **dependent variables that take continuous or ordered discrete values**, with prediction error typically measured by the **squared difference** between the observed and predicted values. \n",
